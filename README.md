# 8-Bit CPU
![CPU Schematic](Additional%20Media\CPU-8-final-final.png)

\
This project is a simple 8-bit CPU built inside of [Sebastian Lague's Digital Logic Simulator](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim).\
Inside of this project file is every single chip I used in the CPU as well as some extra QoL chips.\
\
The CPU features:
- 4-bit Multiplication
- 8-bit Addition/Subtraction
- 8-bit Integers
- 8-bit logical operations (negate, xor, and, or)
- Program address jumping
- Storing values in RAM and ALU
- Dynamic values (reading from RAM/ALU into RAM/ALU/PC)
- Static values (Data ROM)
- Harvard style architecture

Full documentation for the CPU is avaliable [here](https://github.com/Nadelio/8-Bit-CPU/blob/main/DOCS.md)
